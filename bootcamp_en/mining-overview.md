# An overview of mining

Cryptocurrency mining is the act of a computer solving mathematical problems to find the next block in the cryptocurrency's blockchain. Mining
also verifies other transactions on the network.

You can mine cryptocurrencies using your Intel or AMD CPU as well as your Nvidia or AMD GPU/graphics cards.

### Profitability

Depending on where you stay and what you mine you might not make a lot of money in the first couple of days or weeks. You should aim to mine as many coins as you can so that when the coin's price increases, you may make a good profit.
