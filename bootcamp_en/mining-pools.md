# Pools

Mining can be split into two groups, pool and solo mining.

Mining on your own with only your own mining power is called Solo mining. You need enough mining power to find a block on your own. This might be feasable in the first few hours after a coin in launched, but is not recommended. The possibility of you finding a block is very slim.

Pool mining is where you, together with other miners, try to find a block together. If a block is found, the reward is split based on the work each miner did. This is by far the best way to mine. Together you'll find more blocks and thus more rewards.

Pools also show you stats on your mining together with your pending balance and historical hashrate.

**We recommend pool mining**

#### Hashrate distribution

Whenever a single pool controls more that 50% of the combined mining power for a coin they could start to act maliciously. Always try to mine on mid-range pools for a coin to help distribute the hashrate evenly over multiple pools.

Mining on a large pool will give you smaller rewards more often, where smaller pools will give you larger rewards less often. Both eventually balance out to give you the same amount of coins over a long period.

### Supported pools on MiningHQ

We pick two to three reputable pools for each coin supported on MiningHQ. You are free to add your own pool for a coin at any time.
