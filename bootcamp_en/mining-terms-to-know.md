# Terms you should know

These terms are important to know when you are mining. They indicate the
coins you can get from mining and your mining performance.

**Block reward**

The amount of coins created by mining for every new block

**Height**

The current amount of blocks in the coin's blockchain

**Difficulty**

The target amount of hashes that should be created to find the next block.

**Luck**

Luck refers to the percentage of hashes created at the time a block was found.
100% luck means the block was found at the target difficulty. Good luck is anything
below 100% and bad luck is over.

**Hashrate**

The amount of hashes created per second<br />
1 KH/s refers to 1 000 H/s<br />
1 MH/s refers to 1 000 KH/s or 1 000 000 H/s<br />

**Network hashrate**

The combined hashrate of everyone mining this coin. This is an estimate as
no one truly knows the exact network hashrate.

The estimate is calculated by taking the current network difficulty and
dividing it by the amount of seconds for each block.

**Pool hashrate**

The combined hashrate of everyone mining on the pool. This is fairly
accurate but might be averaged over 5 minutes.

**Mining algorithm**

Also known as a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm. It is the sequence of calculations
required to create a single hash.

*MiningHQ currently only supports Cryptonight-based mining. This includes Cryptonight, Cryptonight Lite, Cryptonight Heavy and the variants of each. We will in future support more algorithms.*

**Cryptonight**

A Proof-of-Work mining algorithm. First popularised by the Monero cryptocurrency.
Other versions exist such as cryptonight-lite and cryptonight-heavy.

The standard cryptonight algorithms requires 2MB of L3 CPU cache, lite requires 1MB
while heavy requires 4MB.

Cryptonight, cryptonight-lite and cryptonight-heavy and base algorithms. Some coins
use them directly, others make small tweaks which result in a new variant, such
as cryptonight-fast.
