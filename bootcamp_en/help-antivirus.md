# Mining software and antivirus

Cryptocurrency miners are detected by most antivirus software and removed even though they don't contain any
viruses. To use a computer to mine cryptocurrencies you need to exclude the miner installation path from being scanned.

The MiningHQ installer will tell you which directory to exclude so your miners are not removed.

**We <u>do not</u> recommend that you completely disable your antivirus** but rather only exclude the relevant directory.

#### Guides

Below are some guides on how to exclude a directory for various antivirus software:
