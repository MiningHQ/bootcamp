# Let's Mine!

You now know enough to start mining!

You'll soon find yourself watching your miners, estimated payout, hashrate and
even get to know some coin developers by joining Discord channels. Mining
can truly be a lot of fun.

We wanted to make everything easier, from setting up to picking coins to
keeping an eye on things. That is why we created MiningHQ.

With MiningHQ you can:

1. Check your hashrate, estimated payout and miner stats
2. Set mining strategies to automatically mine different coins
3. Get automatic miner updates
4. Manage your rigs remotely
5. Benchmark your rigs
6. Learn more about any supported coin
7. Show off your hashrate with Discord integration

You'll be mining within 5 minutes.
