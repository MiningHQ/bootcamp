# Exchanges

The place to exchange one currency for another. Similar to a foreign exchange you'll find at an airport or bank.

Most exchanges work as a trading platform as well, you place a trade for currency A using currency B at a specific price
and the trade/exchange will be executed at that price. Or you can simple exchange the currency A for B at the currenct price.


#### Know Your Customer - KYC

Some countries and exchanges require you to submit legal personal documents for them to be able to identify you and your trades.
Keep this in mind when working with exchanges and always stay on the right side of the law when exchanging cryptocurrencies.
