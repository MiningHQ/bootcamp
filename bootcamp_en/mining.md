# Mining

Cryptocurrency mining is the act of a computer solving mathematical problems to find the next block in the cryptocurrency's blockchain.


## Algorithms

The algorithm, also know as the Proof of Work algorithm defines the set of math problems the computer needs to solve for a share in the next block found.

	MiningHQ currently only supports *Cryptonight*-based mining. This includes Cryptonight, Cryptonight Lite, Cryptonight Heavy and the variants of each.
	We will in future support more algorithms.
