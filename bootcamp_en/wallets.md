# Wallets

You can think of a wallet as a bank account. You use it to send, store and receive cryptocurrencies. The one major difference? YOU are in control of your wallet. No one else.
This means that you can transact as you wish with anyone and no person or company can freeze your wallet or delay your transactions.

**With this power comes great responsibility**

Because you are in control of your own wallet, you must keep your wallet information safe. If you loose your wallet details, **no one can recover it** for you. Most cryptocurrencies generate wallets with 'seed words'. You **must** keep those seed words safe. We can not stress this enough.

Your wallet address is *meant* to be used publicly, <u>everything else</u> must be kept <u>safe</u> and <u>secret</u>.


##### Paper wallets

Paper wallets are simple web pages that you can use to generate a wallet with. You must import a paper wallet (using the seed words) into a GUI or CLI wallet to use it. Paper wallets are convenient when you wish to get a wallet or address very quickly.


##### GUI Wallets (Graphical User Interface Wallets)

GUI wallets are visual applications that you use to transact.
Below is a screenshot of a GUI wallet

##### CLI Wallets (Command-line Interface Wallets)

CLI wallets are command-line, text, wallets. They can perform the same functions as a GUI wallet, just without the nice looking visuals.
