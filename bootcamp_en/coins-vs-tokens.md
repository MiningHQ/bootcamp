# Coins vs Tokens

Cryptocurrencies can be split into two groups namely coins and tokens. There is no 100% clear definition written for each yet, so the following acts as a guide.

## Coins

Coins are typically used to replace money &mdash; like cash. They usually use their own blockchain and wallet. Bitcoin is the most popular while thousands of altcoins (alternatives to Bitcoin) exist. Because these coins have their own blockchain, you can usually mine them.

#### Privacy coins

Privacy coins are implemented in such a way that only you know the balance of your wallet. You'd think this is standard, but it is not. Anyone with your Bitcoin wallet address can check how many Bitcoins you have. Privacy coins like Monero hide your balance, only you can see it.

## Tokens

Tokens can represent more that just money. You can have a token be anything you want it to be. They typically do not have their own blockchain and is usually implemented using the ERC20 standard running on top of Ethereum. Because they don't have their own blockchain, they can't be mined the same way most coins can.
