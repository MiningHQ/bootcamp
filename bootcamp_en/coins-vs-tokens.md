# Coins vs Tokens

Cryptocurrencies can by split into two groups namely coins and tokens. There is no 100% clear definition written for each yet, so the following acts as a guide.

## Coins

Coins are typically used to replace money - like cash. Also, they usually use their own blockchain and wallets. They are know as 'altcoins' - or an alternative to bitcoin. Because
these coins have their own blockchain, you can usually mine them.

### Privacy coins

Privacy coins are implemented in such a way that only you know the balance of your wallet. You'd think this is standard, but it is not. Anyone with your Bitcoin wallet 
address can check how many Bitcoins you have. Privacy coins like Monero hide your balance, only you can check the balance.


## Tokens

Tokens can represent more that just money. You can have a token be anything you want it to be. They typically do not have their own blockchain and is usually implemented using
the ERC20 standard running on top of Ethereum or Waves. Because they don't have their own blockchain, they can't be mined the same way most coins can.

### Typical terms to know

**Supply**

This is the total amount of coins that will ever exist

**Circulating supply**

The total amount of coins that exist at this time

**Block reward**

The amount of coins created by mining for every new block

**Price**

The current price of a single unit of a currency, usually price in Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC is the smallest unit in Bitcoin)

**Market cap**

Usually stated in US$, it is the circulating supply multipled by the currenct price. It represents the total
current value of an entire coin.

(circulating supply * price in BTC) * BTC price in US$
